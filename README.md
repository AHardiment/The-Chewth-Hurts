# Some thoughts in hindsight

The name is a sarcastic commentary on the fact that I had problems with scope creep (biting off more than I could chew), due to this being my first complete project. In hindsight I would have tried a more limited approach that allowed for greater polish on each aspect.

Despite this, I believe the game has its strengths and is a fun way to spend a few minutes.
